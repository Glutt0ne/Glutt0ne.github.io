Today I wanted to dive into things I am unfamiliar with. I will be going over the reverse challenge "Snake"

I have a basic understanding of Python and no experience of reverse engineering. I will be going over how I figured out the challenge.

First I will download the program and unzip with the included password of "hackthebox"

I see that we are given a number of "178" and needing to enter a correct username. If we re-run this program we can see the number changes, lets take a look at the code.

Looking at the code, it looks like the number given at the beginning of each run is a random integer. I also see that we have a empty array for "chars" and multiple arrays and vars in hex. lets see what they are.

I am going to brush up on my Python and take snips of this code to debug and see how everything works in a new file. I will upload this file once cleaned up into my GitHub for all to view.

Looking into the code, I can see only 3 arrays are needed. "chars" which is empty at the beginning, "keys" which is a array in hex, and "password" which is another array in hex. the array "auth" is not called anywhere so I will comment it out.

I notice that the var "slither" is the username. So I copied the hex and ran "hex2raw" to get the value.

Continuing on in the code I can see that the keys array gets xor'd with the lock. After the xor, the output gets appened to the empty "chars" array. In the "chains" array, each hex item has "0xA"(10) added to it. This again gets appended to the "chars" array.

Now that I know how this script works, I can create my own script to solve. I know the flag is in the following format:

>HTB{username:password}

We know the username because of the slither variable, the password I found to be misleading. The password in the flag is NOT what was used to solve the file. I had found the actual password for the flag was the encrypted key(labeled as keys_encrypt).
