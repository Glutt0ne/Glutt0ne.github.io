Good afternoon ladies and gentelmen!
Today I will be going over the machine "Lame" on HackTheBox.

Lame is by far the easiest machine on HackTheBox.

First we are going to connect to HackTheBox by using the .ovpn file.
> openvpn Glutt0ne.ovpn
Once connected we will ping the machine to verify we are connected.
