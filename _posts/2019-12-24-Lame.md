Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen!
Today I will be going over the machine "Lame" on HackTheBox; Lame was given the IP of 10.10.10.3

Lame is by far the easiest machine on HackTheBox.

First we are going to connect to HackTheBox by using the .ovpn file.
> openvpn Glutt0ne.ovpn

Once connected we will ping the machine to verify we are connected.

Now that we have verified we can ping the machine, first thing we should do is scan with nmap.

> nmap -T4 -sS -O -A -v 10.10.10.3

This will give up a list of open ports and verions of the services running.

Looking at the list of open ports we can see on port 21 VSFTPD is running on version 2.3.4. While this version is exploitable, the exploit will not work in this instance. The service we want to exploit is Samba on port 139.

Samba is a service used by many operating systems to provide file and print services. The version of samba running is 3.0.20, this version is vulnerable through command execution.

The vulnerability works by executing shellcode in the username field during the SMB connection. There is a metasploit module available, so for simplicity sake; we will use it.

After running the module we have the id of 'root' and able to retrieve the flags!
