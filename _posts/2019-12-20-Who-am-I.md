Who exactly am I?!

I'm Nathen Young, 23 year old male born in Iowa and spent most of my time in California.

I enlisted in the U.S. Army as a 25B(Information Technology Specialist) in 2014 and will be leaving service in early 2020!

I have spent most of my time in the Army performing as a Network Administrator, I learned most of what I know through self-study and boredom.

While I do have many skills related to my current job(OSPF, BGP, NHRP, PIM, DMVPNs, Cisco switching and routing, managing ASA Firewalls, Cisco CallManager, System Administration, Network Administration, VMware, etc.); I only hold two certifications(Network+ and Security+)!

While I can get out with my two certifications, secret security clearance and land myself in a entry network admin role; I really want to persure what I love the most, Security.

What I plan to do with this site is mainly to keep my sanity while I'm in Kuwait; I also want a place where I can show what I have accomplished without a degree.

So now that you know who I am, please enjoy what knowledge I have to offer.
